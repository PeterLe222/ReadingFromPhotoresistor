Pickup any four numbers from the Morse
Code table. Implement a system, that is
able to transmit the morse code of those
numbers that you just picked up in
random order. Arduino should send them
to a led, which should blink according to
morse code.
There should also be a light sensitive
sensor in your device so, that the sent
code can be catched and shown in a seven
segment display.
Your device should work so, that it
randomly is transmitting the morse code
of one of those four numbers that you
selected in the beginning. The sensor
should recognize the code and after that
Arduino should show the sent number in a
display
